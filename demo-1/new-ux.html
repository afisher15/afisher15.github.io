      Neil deGrasse Tyson is stepping up his game, roaring,
      cajoling, stomping his big, considerable, eloquent self to
      say we have got to, got to, GOT TO, step off this planet and
      go places, back to the moon, on to Mars, that we can't afford
      not to, that if we don't, if we don't support a manned space
      program, we are robbing ourselves, we are stepping on "the
      foundations of tomorrow's economies," without which, "we
      might as well slide back to the cave, because that's where
      we're headed now, broke!"

      He's serious. Crazy (as usual), passionate (always), smart
      (no doubt). Just listen to him in this montage, taken from
      his speeches, TV appearances, assembled by Evan Shurr,
      apparently to support more funding for NASA.

      I remember those days, when you could grow up in the
      "Skyview" apartments (as Neil did in the Bronx) and dream of
      being up there with Glenn and Aldrin and Armstrong, feel like
      you were living in an explorer's age, that you could ride
      with your heroes and cheer from the bleachers (your living
      room in front of the TV) as your nation tumbled into space.
      It was amazing. And like Neil, I want those days back.

    <h3>The Question</h3>

    <p>
      But here's my question: Do we need NASA (or the Chinese,
      Russian, Japanese, European, Indian space agencies) to get
      there anymore? Neil seems to think we do. NASA's greatest,
      astronauts Neil Armstrong and Gene Cernan, went to Congress
      early in the Obama Administration to say that the new president
      is wrong to support (and direct NASA to support) private
      commercial efforts. Business folks won't do it safely, said
      Cernan. But businesses are doing it anyway. Just last week a
      commercially-built rocket (from Elon Musk's California company,
      SpaceX) traveled to the space station, docked, and delivered
      cargo - so NASA no longer has to rely on Russian rockets to
      make deliveries. It was a thrilling, entrepreneurial, bootstrap
      performance (with, yes, a $1.6 billion contract from NASA),
      but where were the cheers?
